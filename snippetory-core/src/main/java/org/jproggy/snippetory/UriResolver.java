/**
 * <p>
 * The UrlResolver allows a repository-like definition of templates
 * that are available within a template context. This offers different
 * possibilities including switching between template sets.
 * <p>
 * The User of the configured TemplateContext only needs to know a uri
 * of a template. As the TemplateContext is provided for resolution
 * schemes based on encoding or locale are possible.
 * <p>
 * Hence the UrlResolver mechanism provides a clearly bordered repository
 * while the Repo class rather provides access to the global repository.
 * <p>
 * This class already provides some basic implementations. However,
 * for the moment none of them draws the context into account. But
 * more sophisticated algorithms are likely to be based on Locale
 * or Encoding.
