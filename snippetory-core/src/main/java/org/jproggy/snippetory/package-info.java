/**
 * The classes necessary for the work with the Snippetory Template Engine.
 * This package contains all classes that are intended to be the interface for the
 * usage of the template engine. I.e. reading the templates, composing the texts,
 * binding the data and so on.
 * <p>
 * In most cases it should be fine to start with {@link org.jproggy.snippetory.Repo Repo} and select proposals
 * of your IDE. The fluent interface offers great guidance here.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * At some point you will have to deal with several {@link org.jproggy.snippetory.Template Templates}
 * </p>
