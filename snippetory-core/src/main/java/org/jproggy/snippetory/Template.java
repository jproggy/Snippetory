/**
 * The Template is the central interface of the Snippetory Template Engine. 
 * A Template has two faces. It's a template or a snippet. It describes how 
 * data is bound to create an output. However, it's a repository of snippets as 
 * well. This introduces new possibilities of (re-)usage to template code. Any 
 * Template can be reused as needed and combined with any other Template. As 
 * simple as calling a method.<br /> 
 * <br />
 * It abstracts from most technical issues of the output by handling several
 * typical issues when generating textual languages interpreted by other machines
 * and presented to humans all over the world. On one hand any target language needs
 * some help to maintain syntactical correctness.<br />
 * {@link Encoding}s are designed to deliver this help by escaping characters or terms to
 * keep their original meaning instead of confusing the target parser or provide 
 * possibilities for several types of attacks. As the needs differ and grow additional 
 * encodings can be added and existing can be replaced.<br />
 * To achieve a professional presentation to people of different languages, throughout
 * a mix of transmission languages and technologies you need a quite flexible and
 * robust formatting system. This is provided with a chain of type sensitive 
 * formatters applied just before encoding. And as formatting is part of the look of the
 * result it is useful to have it in the template.<br />
 * <br />
 * The next important aspect of the design of Snippetory is, that logic separated from view.
 * No loops, no conditions, no variable definitions and manipulations in the template.
 * (by the way, we'll talk of variables in some cases, but formally that are just 
 * location marks in the template not a declaration and several usages, that have to
 * be in sequence) And freeing template from logic means freeing from context. And
 * in consequence it is easy to take a peace of template and use it where appropriate. 
 * This means an abstraction from template storage and organization and allows one to 
 * organize the template structure as needed.
